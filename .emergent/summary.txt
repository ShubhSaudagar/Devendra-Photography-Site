The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack photography portfolio website, D.S.P.Film’s, through multiple iterations. Initially, a basic frontend with mock data was built. Following user dissatisfaction with the UI, a significant redesign was executed, leveraging brand analysis and incorporating specific client details, resulting in a futuristic design. The project then transitioned to backend development, establishing a FastAPI API with MongoDB and integrating it with the frontend. A comprehensive CMS, including theme and content management, was also implemented. The final phase focused heavily on resolving complex dependency and deployment issues for Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend), primarily battling Pydantic/FastAPI version incompatibilities and Gunicorn configuration errors on Render, and fixing minor UI glitches.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was grappling with persistent backend deployment issues on Render. The user reported a  originating from Pydantic within the FastAPI application, and a Gunicorn import error. This is a recurring problem despite previous attempts to fix dependency versions (fastapi, pydantic, pydantic-core, typing-extensions) in . The previous fix involved adjusting the Gunicorn start command and ensuring compatible Pydantic versions that didn't require Rust compilation.

The user is explicitly frustrated and wants the deployment issue solved in one go using minimum possible credits/tokens without modifying site features or design.

Prior to these deployment issues, the AI engineer had successfully addressed a UI bug where the testimonials section experienced light flickering/lag when the cursor was around it. This was fixed by removing the  class and related blur effects from the  component to ensure a smoother user experience. All other features, including the comprehensive CMS, frontend design, and API integrations, were reported as working correctly.
