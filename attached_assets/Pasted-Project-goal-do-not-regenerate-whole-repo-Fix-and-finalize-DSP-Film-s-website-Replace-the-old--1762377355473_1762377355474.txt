Project goal (do not regenerate whole repo):
Fix and finalize DSP Film’s website:

Replace the old, broken admin with a new, lightweight React Admin (fully working)

Make the public site match https://photopanel.preview.emergentagent.com/ visually and functionally

Wire everything to existing FastAPI backend (Render) and deploy (Vercel + Render)

0) Non-negotiables

Do NOT change env names. Frontend must read:

REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://devendra-photography-site.onrender.com


Keep existing Mongo + auth; just add missing models/APIs if needed.

Remove dead/admin UI from Emergent; build a new minimal admin in frontend/src/admin (or reuse /admin route), with clean purple theme.

All admin routes must be JWT-protected using /api/admin/auth/login.

Replace all “Maternity” labels on public site with “Maternity | NewBorn & Family”.

1) Admin panel – must have (simple & solid)

React admin with these pages (client-side routes under /admin):

/admin/login (email+password → JWT saved in HttpOnly cookie if available; else in memory)

/admin/dashboard

/admin/packages (CRUD)

/admin/gallery (Upload, List, Delete)

Global Logout

Footer: © 2025 DSP Films. Developed by Shubh Saudagar.

Packages CRUD UI

Fields: title, subtitle, category, price, features[] (strings), terms[] (strings), ctaText (string, default "Book Now"), waNumber (string), waMessageTemplate (string)

Auto-computed CTA link:
https://wa.me/${waNumber}?text=${encodeURIComponent(waMessageTemplate)}
Default: number = 918308398378, template = Hi, I'm interested in the "<title>" package.

Gallery UI

Upload to /api/admin/gallery/upload (multipart), store under backend/uploads, list & delete endpoints.

Auth

Use /api/admin/auth/login and protect admin routes (redirect to login on 401).

2) Backend model & endpoints (only if missing)

Create/ensure Package model in Mongo (collection: packages):

{
  _id,
  title: string,
  subtitle: string,
  category: "WEDDING" | "PRE-WEDDING" | "MATERNITY_NEWBORN_FAMILY",
  price: number, // in INR
  features: string[],
  terms: string[],
  ctaText: string, // "Book Now"
  waNumber: string, // "918308398378"
  waMessageTemplate: string,
  createdAt, updatedAt
}


Public endpoints

GET /api/packages → list grouped by category (use same order as seed below)

GET /api/gallery → list images

Admin endpoints (JWT required)

POST /api/admin/packages (create)

PUT /api/admin/packages/:id (update)

DELETE /api/admin/packages/:id (delete)

POST /api/admin/gallery/upload (multipart) → { url, id }

DELETE /api/admin/gallery/:id

Health

keep GET /api/health working.

3) Public site requirements (match the preview exactly)

Replicate layout/spacing/typography of https://photopanel.preview.emergentagent.com/ for these sections:

Hero, About, Packages with details & CTA, Gallery/Portfolio, Contact.

Packages section must render from GET /api/packages.

Each package card shows: title, subtitle, price, features list, terms, and a Book Now button linking to WhatsApp (computed).

In Services/Portfolio/Packages areas, rename “Maternity” to “Maternity | NewBorn & Family”.

4) Seed data (create a one-time admin seeder or migration)

Insert or upsert the following three categories with order preserved:

Create a one-time script (e.g., backend/seed_packages.py) that upserts by title+category. Call it during first boot if no packages exist.

5) Build & Deploy

Ensure frontend builds (prefer yarn if lockfile exists; else npm). Resolve any framer-motion/react-spring conflicts by choosing one (prefer framer-motion v^10+).

Remove dead routes from old admin; keep /admin/* mapped to new React admin.

Finally:

Save all files

git add .

git commit -m "final: production-ready admin rebuild + packages & gallery CRUD + public site parity"

git push origin main

Create /FINAL_REPORT.txt with:

Admin routes list

API list

Credentials variable names

How to add/edit packages

WhatsApp CTA logic

Success criteria

/admin/login accepts the existing admin credentials from secrets.

/admin/packages FULL CRUD works; WhatsApp links correct.

/admin/gallery upload/list/delete works; images show on public gallery.

Public site matches preview; “Maternity” → “Maternity | NewBorn & Family”.

Vercel build green; Render health GET /api/health ok.
